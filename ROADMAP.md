# Merlian — Roadmap (v1)

This roadmap is intentionally opinionated and narrow. Merlian is a commercial product first.

## Now (0–2 weeks): Make the wow reproducible
**Milestone: Personal Demo onboarding**
- Index a small *recent* sample fast (e.g., last 200 screenshots)
- Drop user into a curated Local Gallery view (demo-like experience)
- Lenses/views (not hard-coded artifacts): Errors, Codes, Receipts, Charts

**Milestone: Evidence-first results**
- OCR preview everywhere
- OCR region highlight in detail view
- One-click actions: open / reveal / copy

## Next (2–6 weeks): Trust + reliability
- Permissions UX (macOS)
- What’s indexed / forget folder / nuke index
- Performance guardrails (pause/throttle)

## Later: Packaging + distribution
- Tauri wrapper for hotkey + background indexing
- Bundle engine (no manual Python setup)
- Private alpha → beta

## Not on the roadmap (v1)
- Accounts / sharing / cloud upload
- Public discovery network
- “Chat with your photos” as the primary interface
